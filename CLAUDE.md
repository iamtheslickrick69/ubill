# Ubill.io - Utility Bill Analysis & Solar Readiness Platform

## Project Overview

**Ubill.io** is a free transparency tool that empowers homeowners to understand their energy bills and make informed decisions about solar energy. Built by Rocky Bunker, a former solar salesman in California who discovered that his success came from his ability to teach people about their confusing energy bills.

## The Problem

Utility bills are incredibly confusing:
- Complex rate structures
- Meter readings that don't make sense
- Usage calculations that are unclear
- Hidden taxes and credits
- Multiple line items that obscure the actual cost

Most homeowners have no idea how much they're actually paying per kilowatt, yet they know exactly how much they pay for gas. This information asymmetry makes it easy for salespeople to fudge numbers when pitching solar, and makes it hard for homeowners to know if solar actually makes financial sense.

## The Solution

Ubill.io provides clarity through:

1. **OCR Bill Analysis** - Upload a utility bill and get instant analysis
2. **Cost Transparency** - See exactly how much you're paying per kilowatt
3. **Solar Readiness Score** - Get an objective assessment of whether solar makes sense for your situation
4. **Educational Resources** - Learn about energy bills and solar in an accessible way
5. **Resource Connections** - Get connected to legitimate solar providers and other energy savings programs if you're a good fit
6. **Gamified Experience** - Interactive learning about energy bills and solar technology

## Core Mission

**Transparency and Empowerment**

Solar only makes sense if the numbers pencil out. This tool exists to:
- Give homeowners the same level of understanding about their energy costs as they have for other expenses
- Prevent misleading sales tactics through objective analysis
- Provide free, unbiased education about energy consumption and solar options
- Connect the right people to the right resources

## Key Features

- **Free Tool** - No cost to homeowners
- **Objective Analysis** - Pure numbers, no sales pitch
- **Educational First** - Teaching over selling
- **Transparency** - Clear breakdown of actual costs
- **Resource Matching** - Only connect people who are actually good candidates for solar

## Target Users

Homeowners who want to:
- Understand what they're actually paying for energy
- Determine if solar makes financial sense for their situation
- Learn about their utility bill without sales pressure
- Make informed decisions based on real numbers

## Creator Background

Built by Rocky Bunker, who sold solar in California for several years and realized that his success came from teaching people how to read their utility bills, not from aggressive sales tactics. The complexity of utility bills became the inspiration for building a tool that could help everyone understand their energy costs.

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Shadcn UI components
- OCR technology for bill analysis
- Gamification elements for education

## Development Philosophy

This is about empowering people with knowledge, not selling them something. Every feature should prioritize clarity, education, and honest transparency over conversion metrics.
